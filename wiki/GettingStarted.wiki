#summary Getting started with Spock.

= Getting started on the command line =

 * Download and setup Java 5 or higher (JRE will do for our purposes) 
 * Download and setup Groovy 1.6.x

Detailed instructions for these two steps can be found in the [http://groovy.codehaus.org/Tutorial+1+-+Getting+started Groovy tutorial].

`groovyc --version` (note the two dashes) should now give something like:

{{{
Groovy compiler version 1.6.0
Copyright 2003-2008 The Codehaus. http://groovy.codehaus.org/
}}}

 * Download and extract JUnit 4.4 or higher
 * Download spock-core-0.1.jar
 * Create a file named `!HelloSpock.groovy` with the following content:

{{{
import org.spockframework.dsl.*

@Speck
@RunWith(Sputnik)
class HelloSpock {
    def "can you figure out what I'm up to?"() {
        expect:
        name.size() == size

        where:
        name << ["Kirk", "Spock", "Scotty"]
        size << [4, 5, 6]
    }
}
}}}

 * Compile the specification with `groovyc HelloSpock.groovy --classpath path_to_junit_jar path_to_spock_jar
 * Run the specification with `java org.junit.runner.JUnitCore HelloSpock -cp path_to_junit_jar path_to_spock_jar`
