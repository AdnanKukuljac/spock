#summary Run your first Spock specification.
#labels Featured

Getting started with Spock is really easy: Just download the example project (spock-example-02.zip), type `./gradlew` test (Windows: `gradlew test`), and seconds later, you will be running your first Spock specifications! The only prerequisite is that you have JDK 5 or higher installed. Everything else will be downloaded automatically. Also included are build scripts for Ant and Maven. For further instructions, see the README file.

The remainder of this page explains in detail how to run [HelloSpock HelloSpock.groovy] in the following environments:

<wiki:toc />
 
== Command line ==

 * Download and setup Java 5 or higher (JRE will do for our purposes)
 * Download and setup Groovy 1.6.3 binary release ([http://groovy.codehaus.org/Download download page])

Detailed instructions for these two steps can be found in the [http://groovy.codehaus.org/Tutorial+1+-+Getting+started Groovy tutorial].

 * Download junit-4.6.jar ([http://sourceforge.net/projects/junit/files/ download page])
 * Download spock-core-0.2.jar ([http://code.google.com/p/spock/downloads/list download page])
 * Create a file named !HelloSpock.groovy with the following content: [HelloSpock HelloSpock.groovy]
 * Run !HelloSpock with `groovy -cp "junit-4.6.jar:spock-core-0.2.jar" HelloSpock` (make sure the classpath is correct; on Windows, separate classpath entries with `;` instead of `:`)

== Ant ==

Verified against Ant 1.7

 * Create file build.xml with the following content: [HelloSpockBuildXml build.xml]
 * Create file src/!HelloSpock.groovy with the following content: [HelloSpock HelloSpock.groovy]
 * Run !HelloSpock with `ant test`
 
== Gradle ==

Verified against Gradle 0.6

 * Create file build.gradle with the following content: [HelloSpockGradleScript build.gradle]
 * Create file src/test/groovy/!HelloSpock.groovy with the following content: [HelloSpock HelloSpock.groovy]
 * Run !HelloSpock with `gradle test`

== Maven ==

Verified against Maven 2.1

 * Create file pom.xml with the following content: [HelloSpockPom pom.xml]
 * Create file src/test/groovy/!HelloSpock.groovy with the following content: [HelloSpock HelloSpock.groovy]
 * Run !HelloSpock with `mvn test`

The Groovy Eclipse plugin is currently undergoing a major overhaul. A first version of the new plugin should be released shortly. Meanwhile, here is a screenshot posted to the Groovy mailing list (thanks to Andy Clement) showing !HelloSpock in action:
