== Command line ==

 * Download and setup Java 5 or higher (JRE will do for our purposes)
 * Download and setup Groovy 1.6.x binary release ([http://groovy.codehaus.org/Download download page])

Detailed instructions for these two steps can be found in the [http://groovy.codehaus.org/Tutorial+1+-+Getting+started Groovy tutorial].

 * Download junit-4.4.jar or higher ([http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=15278&package_id=12472 download page])
 * Download spock-core-0.1.jar or higher ([http://code.google.com/p/spock/downloads/list download page])
 * Create a file named !HelloSpock.groovy with the following content: [HelloSpock HelloSpock.groovy]
 * Run !HelloSpock with `groovy -cp "junit-4.4.jar:spock-core-0.1.jar" HelloSpock` (you may need to edit the Jar paths; on Windows, separate the paths with `;` instead of `:`)

== Ant ==

Tested with Ant 1.7.

 * Create file build.xml with the following content: [HelloSpockBuildXml build.xml]
 * Create file src/!HelloSpock.groovy with the following content: [HelloSpock HelloSpock.groovy]
 * Run !HelloSpock with `ant test`
 
== Gradle ==

This section will be updated as soon as Gradle adds support for Groovy 1.6. If you don't want to wait, have a look at Spock's own Gradle build, in particular the spock-specks project.

== Maven ==

Tested with Maven 2.0.9.

 * Create file pom.xml with the following content: [HelloSpockPom pom.xml]
 * Create file src/test/groovy/!HelloSpock.groovy with the following content: [HelloSpock HelloSpock.groovy]
 * Run !HelloSpock with `mvn test`

 * Download junit-4.4.jar or higher ([http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=15278&package_id=12472 download page]) 
 * Download spock-core-0.1.jar or higher ([http://code.google.com/p/spock/downloads/list download page])
 * Create a new IDEA project named !HelloSpock and add a Java module.
 * Add a Groovy facet and point the "Groovy SDK" to your Groovy folder
 * In "Module settings", add a "Single-Entry Module Library" for junit-4.4.jar, and another one for spock-core-0.1.jar
 * In the src folder, create a Groovy class named !HelloSpock with the following content: [HelloSpock HelloSpock.groovy]
 * In the "Project" window, right-click on !HelloSpock and select "Run"
