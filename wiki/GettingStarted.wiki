#summary Run your first Spock specification.
#labels Featured

The easiest way to get to know Spock is http://webconsole.spockframework.org, which instantly lets you view, edit, run and even publish Spock specifications for others to see. Zero install required!

If you prefer to run Spock on your machine, just download [https://github.com/spockframework/spock-example/zipball/0.6 spock-example-0.6.zip] and type `./gradlew test` (Windows: `gradlew test`). Seconds later, you will be running your first Spock specifications. The only prerequisite is that you have JDK 5 or higher installed; everything else will be downloaded automatically. Also included are build scripts for Ant and Maven. For further instructions, see the README file.

The remainder of this page explains in detail how to run [HelloSpock HelloSpock.groovy] in the following environments:

<wiki:toc />
 
== Command line ==

 * Download and setup Java 5 or higher (JRE will do for our purposes)
 * Download and setup Groovy 1.8.6 binary release ([http://groovy.codehaus.org/Download download page])

Detailed instructions for these two steps can be found in the [http://groovy.codehaus.org/Tutorial+1+-+Getting+started Groovy tutorial].

 * Download junit-4.9.jar ([http://sourceforge.net/projects/junit/files/ download page])
 * Download [http://repo1.maven.org/maven2/org/spockframework/spock-core/0.6-groovy-1.8/spock-core-0.6-groovy-1.8.jar spock-core-0.6-groovy-1.8.jar]
 * Create a file named !HelloSpock.groovy with the following content: [HelloSpock HelloSpock.groovy]
 * Run !HelloSpock with `groovy -cp "junit-4.9.jar:spock-core-0.6.jar" HelloSpock` (make sure the classpath is correct; on Windows, separate classpath entries with `;` instead of `:`)

== Ant ==

Verified against Ant 1.8

 * Create file build.xml with the following content: [HelloSpockBuildXml build.xml]
 * Create file src/!HelloSpock.groovy with the following content: [HelloSpock HelloSpock.groovy]
 * Run !HelloSpock with `ant test`
 
== Gradle ==

Verified against Gradle 0.6

 * Create file build.gradle with the following content: [HelloSpockGradleScript build.gradle]
 * Create file src/test/groovy/!HelloSpock.groovy with the following content: [HelloSpock HelloSpock.groovy]
 * Run !HelloSpock with `gradle test`

== Maven ==

Verified against Maven 2.1

 * Create file pom.xml with the following content: [HelloSpockPom pom.xml]
 * Create file src/test/groovy/!HelloSpock.groovy with the following content: [HelloSpock HelloSpock.groovy]
 * Run !HelloSpock with `mvn test`

== Eclipse ==

The Groovy Eclipse plugin provides solid Spock support.

*Important Information:* 
 * Make sure to use the latest release or snapshot version of the Groovy Eclipse plugin.
 * After installing the Groovy Eclipse plugin, enable the following option: Preferences->Groovy->Use monospace font for JUnit. Now all output in the JUnit view should use the editor font (this is especially important for Spock's condition output shown in the screenshot below). If this doesn't work immediately, uncheck the option, press 'Apply', and check the option again.
 * For Eclipse 3.5 and below, make sure you have a source attachment set for the spock-core Jar. (Otherwise you might run into the following Eclipse JDT bug: https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=175582) For Maven projects, the easiest way to achieve this is `mvn eclipse:eclipse -DdownloadSources`.  

Here is a screenshot of Spock in action:

== IntelliJ IDEA ==

For IDEA 9, 10, 11:

 * Download and extract Groovy 1.8.6 binary release ([http://groovy.codehaus.org/Download download page])
 * Download junit-4.9.jar ([http://sourceforge.net/projects/junit/files/ download page]) 
 * Download [http://repo1.maven.org/maven2/org/spockframework/spock-core/0.6-groovy-1.8/spock-core-0.6-groovy-1.8.jar spock-core-0.6-groovy-1.8.jar]
 * Create a new IDEA project named !HelloSpock and add a Java module.
 * In "Module settings", add a "Single-Entry Module Library" for groovy-all-1.8.6.jar, junit-4.9.jar, and spock-core-0.6.jar
 * In the src folder, create a Groovy class named !HelloSpock with the following content: [HelloSpock HelloSpock.groovy]
 * In the "Project" window, right-click on !HelloSpock and select "Run"

== Netbeans ==

As of Netbeans 6.7.1/6.8M1, the !NetBeans Groovy plugin does not support running JUnit 4 tests, and therefore Spock specifications. For general information about the !NetBeans Groovy plugin, go to http://groovy.codehaus.org/NetBeans+Plugin.
