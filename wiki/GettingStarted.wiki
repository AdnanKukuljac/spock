#summary Run your first Spock specification.
#labels Featured

Getting started with Spock is really easy: Just download the example project ([http://spock.googlecode.com/files/spock-example-0.2.zip spock-example-02.zip]), type `./gradlew test` (Windows: `gradlew test`), and seconds later, you will be running your first Spock specifications! The only prerequisite is that you have JDK 5 or higher installed. Everything else will be downloaded automatically. Also included are build scripts for Ant and Maven. For further instructions, see the README file.

The remainder of this page explains in detail how to run [HelloSpock HelloSpock.groovy] in the following environments:

<wiki:toc />
 
== Command line ==

 * Download and setup Java 5 or higher (JRE will do for our purposes)
 * Download and setup Groovy 1.6.3 binary release ([http://groovy.codehaus.org/Download download page])

Detailed instructions for these two steps can be found in the [http://groovy.codehaus.org/Tutorial+1+-+Getting+started Groovy tutorial].

 * Download junit-4.6.jar ([http://sourceforge.net/projects/junit/files/ download page])
 * Download spock-core-0.2.jar ([http://code.google.com/p/spock/downloads/list download page])
 * Create a file named !HelloSpock.groovy with the following content: [HelloSpock HelloSpock.groovy]
 * Run !HelloSpock with `groovy -cp "junit-4.6.jar:spock-core-0.2.jar" HelloSpock` (make sure the classpath is correct; on Windows, separate classpath entries with `;` instead of `:`)

== Ant ==

Verified against Ant 1.7

 * Create file build.xml with the following content: [HelloSpockBuildXml build.xml]
 * Create file src/!HelloSpock.groovy with the following content: [HelloSpock HelloSpock.groovy]
 * Run !HelloSpock with `ant test`
 
== Gradle ==

Verified against Gradle 0.6

 * Create file build.gradle with the following content: [HelloSpockGradleScript build.gradle]
 * Create file src/test/groovy/!HelloSpock.groovy with the following content: [HelloSpock HelloSpock.groovy]
 * Run !HelloSpock with `gradle test`

== Maven ==

Verified against Maven 2.1

 * Create file pom.xml with the following content: [HelloSpockPom pom.xml]
 * Create file src/test/groovy/!HelloSpock.groovy with the following content: [HelloSpock HelloSpock.groovy]
 * Run !HelloSpock with `mvn test`

== Eclipse ==

The pre-release version of the Groovy Eclipse plugin V2.0 already provides solid Spock support.

*Important Information:* 
 * The Groovy Eclipse plugin is evolving rapidly. Currently we recommend to use the latest snapshot from http://dist.codehaus.org/groovy/distributions/greclipse/snapshot/e3.5, and to update it frequently.
 * By default, the Groovy Eclipse plugin uses (a pre-release version of) Groovy 1.7. For Groovy 1.7 you need Spock 0.4-groovy-1.7-SNAPSHOT, which is available from http://m2repo.spockframework.org/snapshots. From Spock 0.4 final onwards, the Groovy 1.7 version of Spock will also be available from Maven Central.
 * After installing the Groovy Eclipse plugin, enable the following option: Preferences->Groovy->Use monospace font for JUnit. Now all output in the JUnit view should use the editor font (this is especially important for Spock's condition output shown in the screenshot below). If this doesn't work immediately, uncheck the option, press 'Apply', and check the option again.
 * Make sure you have a source attachment set for the spock-core Jar. (Otherwise you might run into the following Eclipse JDT bug: https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=175582) If you have a Maven project, the easiest way to achieve this is `mvn eclipse:eclipse -DdownloadSources`.  

Here is a screenshot of Spock in action:

== IntelliJ IDEA ==

Verified against IDEA 8.1.2

 * Download and extract Groovy 1.6.3 binary release ([http://groovy.codehaus.org/Download download page])
 * Download junit-4.6.jar ([http://sourceforge.net/projects/junit/files/ download page]) 
 * Download spock-core-0.2.jar ([http://code.google.com/p/spock/downloads/list download page])
 * Create a new IDEA project named !HelloSpock and add a Java module.
 * Add a Groovy facet and point the "Groovy SDK" to your Groovy folder
 * In "Module settings", add a "Single-Entry Module Library" for junit-4.6.jar, and another one for spock-core-0.2.jar
 * In the src folder, create a Groovy class named !HelloSpock with the following content: [HelloSpock HelloSpock.groovy]
 * In the "Project" window, right-click on !HelloSpock and select "Run"

== Netbeans ==

As of Netbeans 6.7.1/6.8M1, the !NetBeans Groovy plugin does not support running JUnit 4 tests, and therefore Spock specifications. For general information about the !NetBeans Groovy plugin, go to http://groovy.codehaus.org/NetBeans+Plugin.
