The Spring extension, currently based on Spring 2.5.x, brings Spring's `TestContext` framework to Spock. Instead of providing its own API, the extension completely relies on the `TestContext` API. To activate the extension, put the `spock-spring` Jar on the (runtime) class path, and annotate your specification with `@ContextConfiguration`. Bean definition files will be read from the given locations, and an application context will be created. To inject beans by type, use the `@Autowired` annotation. To inject beans by name, use the `@Resource` annotation. If required, you can also inject an `ApplicationContext` (but you should prefer injecting beans whenever possible).

The `TestContext` framework provides many features, most of which are supported by the Spring extension. From the annotations (and underlying features) listed in the [http://static.springsource.org/spring/docs/2.5.6/reference/testing.html#testcontext-annotations Spring documentation], all but the following are supported:
  * `@ExpectedException` (use Spock's thrown() method or `@FailsWith` annotation instead)
  * `@Timed` (use Spock's `@Timeout` annotation instead) 
  * `@Repeat` (Spock will likely add a similar feature in the future)
