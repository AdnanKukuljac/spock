#summary Important changes between Spock versions that users should be aware of.

== Version 0.3 (released 2009-11-19) ==

 * `@Speck` has been deprecated. The new way to turn a class into a specification is to extend class `spock.lang.Specification` (or a subclass thereof).
 * `setupSpeck()`/`cleanupSpeck()` have been deprecated and renamed to `setupSpec()`/`cleanupSpec()`.
 * `spock.lang.Predef` has been deprecated. You should no longer directly use this class. Instead, extend from `spock.lang.Specification`, which provides all the same methods.
 * The Maven plugin's `find-specks` goal has been deprecated and renamed to `find-specs`.
 * The Ant selector `SpeckClassFileSelector` has been renamed to `SpecClassFileSelector`.

All deprecated elements will be removed in Spock 0.4.  

== Version 0.4 (released 2010-05-25) ==

 * No incompatible changes.
