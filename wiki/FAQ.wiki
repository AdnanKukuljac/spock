0. Why "Spock"?

 A timely blend of the finest ingredients: "Spec", "Mock", human emotion, and Vulcan brain powder. (Plus, "A`***`Peck" was already taken.)

1. Given that Spock has been in the works for quite a while, why wasn't it released any sooner?

 Vulcan High Command told us to wait for the release of Groovy 1.6, the first Groovy version officially _Designed for Vulcans_^TM^.

2. Are you guys Trekkies by any chance?

 Bingo! But watch out for equally subtle references to Battlestar Galactica, Dr. Who, and other fascinating life forms.

3. Do you have a fun, elegant, colorful logo for Spock?

 No. Do you?

42. Is this the end of the ~~world~~ ~~galaxy~~ ~~fun~~ FAQ?

 Yes, but there's a lot more to explore. Give us a try [http://code.google.com/p/spock/downloads/list now], and we'll throw in a !SpockException for free! (No. It's not that bad. Really.)
